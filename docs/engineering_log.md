Goal: Add multi-transformer support

Completed: 
- Converted Transformer object to transformer list
- added TX-101, TX-102, TX-103
- updated telemetry collection loops for list alteration

Issues: 
- Health report only displayed tx-103 
    Root cause was due to indentation outside of loop. and old code that only showed the last transformer

Next session: 
- improve event state transitions





2026-09-05

Goal: Improve event state transitions and add documentation '

Completed:
- Added decisions,engineering,roadmap, and architecture.md(s) 
-

Issues: Started documentation today so most changes have to be remembered and added at future date
event state handling would flood the terminal with endless data instead of the specific historical data

Lessons learned: Make a habbit of adding documention and making git commits

Next session: complete event state tranisiton


2026-09-09

GOal: complete implementation of improved event state transition

completed: added new_status, and previous_status(also properly used previous_status over previous_health_status so data will show the correct state needed) (Later date change prevous_health_status to hold persistant health status rather than hard coded "normal" in)


lessons learned: Learned the value of testing and implemented new iterations. test for bugs and get it working, then implemenet an optimized way with seperation of concerns to keep clean code and create code that works and can be scaled. 


Next session: Add an operators dashboard




2026-09-16

Goal: Add an operator Dashboard

Completed: Added a basic operator dashboard to be used for the actual web-based dashboard

Next Session: add a system summary to optimise what operators see so only the most important information is shown in proper order of severity.

Lesson learned: Frequent testing at ever section of the project can allow you to fix formatting errors and create the best project possible, The more errors you fix before you get to the end product means a more optimized and precise project.

Goal: create a new operator dasboard and add a dashboard health to display the actual health status of the transformer

Completed: Added display_operator_dashboard and rearranged where the display call is located within while true loop to bottom of the loop. created a dictionary for dashboard_health to allow the dictionary to be populated the analyzed by the display operator dashboard. added asset_id and health to the def display dashboard function to allow equiptment health to be viewed.

lessons learned: Understanding placement of code in a systems mindset to troubleshoot errors in code that might not be shown in the terminal as an error but rather the feautre did not meet the sharholder requirements. The more I work with code the more the patterns make themselves known.

Next session: Add an overall system status to the operator display

2026-09-21

Goal: Add an overall system status to operator display and active alarm section

Completed: Added an overall system status to view total amount of events.

Lessons learned:Adding a counter and linking that coutner to display_health which contains the collected events needed, can give an operator dashboard a cleaner and more effective way at looking at problems that need to be addressed. Adding an active alarm system allows the dashboard to be even cleaner by keeping alarms up until they are cleared instwad on constatly filling the dashboard with events.  .values() only gives the value of a dictionary, while .items() gives the key and value of that dictionary (Side note: .keys() return only the key)

Next session: Real Alarm management system


2026-09-24 

Goal: Implement a realistic alarm management system that distinguishes between the different states of an alarm from created, active, acknowledged and cleared.

Completed: Added a alarm managment system that include new alarm, cleared,

Lessons Learned: Created an active alarm dictionary to allow it to be filled with health_status, health_reason under dashboard_health dictionary. the active alarm will create a table if no active alarm is up and if status != normal. adding feautures like new alarm and cleared alarm took some time due to trying to test whether the added code to clear the alarm works. I was dealing with the random numbers and aggregate functions used to simulate these conditions was causing the values to increase due to incorrect configuration of that code (will revise at future point) Good tip is to clear substation.db and run the code again until it can produce the correct new alarm and clear. (PATIENCE IN TESTING)

Next Session: Make the dashboard use active_alarms


2026-09-25:


Goal: Make the dashboard make use of active_alarms section to allow for an alarm severity feature. currently it just shows a cleared state when it goes to normal. This makes for better state tracking, instead of what is != normal it now shows what alarms are currently active.

Create a new controlled simulator for better testing


lessons learned: Seperation of responsibilities when it comes to how some functions are used and recreated to have cleaner architecture. for example, allowing the dashboard to show the output of active alarms instead of coming from health. health had the same type of code if != normal then show status and reason. however our active alarms already contained this type of feature. instead of having two seperated feautures doing the same thing I replaced it with a call to active alarms, and parsed active alarms within the def dashboard and its call.

my attempt at creating a controlled simulator led to the first iteration being stability. I changed values of the randint to a smaller range and the simulation stopped increasing exponentially. then I created a new update inside tranformer.py to simulate normal, overload, and recovery numbers. this was accomplished by putting simulation_mode inside the init class and make three new simulation_mode normal,recovery,etc.  inside update function. then we call that inside main.py where I set up the equipment by adding transformers[0].simulation_mode=normal and set one for each transformer so I can control what simulation feature I want to see. next was the implementation of the limit. by placing an if temp < 100 it stops the temp from rising to exponetial heights and allows for better testing environment. 

creating scenario cycle to allow program to run without continously stopping and resarting, 
this was accomlplished by adding self.scenario_cycle = 0 otherwise known as a counter. then I set up a if scenario >= 10: enter recovery mode, then from recovery mode it enters normal mode. the testing involed making sure eac iteration worked before adding another feature. first I tested to make sure cycles poped up in the terminal, after that I had to investigate whether the cycle would automatically go thorugh all the iteration and print the required messages. such as alarm clear when it reaches normal.

Next session: Finish the scenario cycle by allowing full transition into each mode, then add an event managment system to record all alarms and changes.
